## What Cannot Be Completed (Blockers)

### Primary Blocker: No DB2 Server Access

**Tasks Blocked**:
- Integration testing with real DB2 database
- Query execution testing
- Export functionality testing
- Connection error testing
- Performance testing
- Query history persistence testing

**Workaround**: Deploy to environment with DB2 access for testing

### Secondary Blocker: No Clean Test Environment

**Tasks Blocked**:
- Clean Windows 11 VM testing
- Offline installation verification
- Self-contained package testing

**Workaround**: Can be tested when VM available

### Optional/Future Enhancements

**Not Blockers**:
- Application icon (can be added later)
- Auto-complete functionality
- Execution plan viewer
- Advanced context menus
- Unit tests (would require DB2 mocking)
